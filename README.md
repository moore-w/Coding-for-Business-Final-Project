# Coding for Business - Final Project
Using data from an MLB data set, I created an interactive platform that allows users to explore team and player statistics. 


Users can:
- Select any MLB team from a dropdown menu of all 30 teams to view the team logo and roster
- Choose a player from the roster and a year to view their statistics from the selected season
